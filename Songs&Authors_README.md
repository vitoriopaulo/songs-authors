This is the first full-stack (front-end and back-end) project developed in
the scope of the program of the WDI (Web Development Immersive) 020 Fall
class Boston.

The web-application was designed as a SPA (Single page application) with basic
user authentication features: sign up, sign in, sign out, change password;
that interacts with a custom built API.

Technologies used to build the front-end of the application:
HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, jQuery, AJAX, GIT, GITHUB.

Concept: A web-based application inspired in the universe of the music.
In it's first version, the app was thought as a place where registered users
could build and manipulate their own list of songs (data) by communicating to
a SQL database from the UI performing CRUD (create, read, update, and delete)
actions.

Issues related to UI|UX, Information of Architecture and Usability: the web
application was designed to be as elegant, minimalist, functional and
aesthetically pleasant to the eyes as possible. An interface to make the user
navigates through it with easy and be motivated to come back by the quality of
it's visual design and easy of usage.

The navigation occurs in two levels: the home-page, where the user do the
Sign Up and Sign In; and the second level of navigation, where the user
has access to all CRUD functionalities related to the interaction with a Sql
database and is also able to change the password and do the sign out.

The following url displays the skecthed wireframe and user stories of the
front-end of the web application:
